Hello! My name is Jonah Fairweather

I am currently studying computer science at McGill university. I am in my second year of studies and really enjoying it!

I am still constantly finding new and interesting ways to apply my knowledge as well as finding ways to apply new knowledge to old concepts that used to give me lots of trouble.

Proficient with C, Python, and Java.

Currently I am learning C# and building games with Unity.
